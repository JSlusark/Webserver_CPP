## 6. **Request Routing**
- **Current:** Routing logic is procedural and spread out.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Use a routing table or map for method/path to handler function.
  - This makes adding new routes or methods easier.

---

## 7. **CGI and Uploads**
- **Current:** CGI and upload logic is mixed with main handlers.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Move CGI and upload logic to their own classes or modules.
  - This keeps the main server logic focused and easier to test.

---

## 8. **File and Path Utilities**
- **Current:** File/path checks and manipulations are inline.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Move all file/path utilities to a dedicated `utils.cpp`/`utils.hpp`.
  - Use RAII for file streams where possible.

---

## 9. **Logging**
- **Current:** Logging is done with `std::cout` and `std::cerr`.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Create a logging utility with levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR).
  - This allows you to control verbosity and redirect logs easily.

---

## 10. **Configuration File Parsing**
- **Current:** The config file is simple, but parsing may be ad-hoc.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Use a dedicated parser class for configuration.
  - Validate config values and provide helpful error messages.

---

## 11. **General C++ Best Practices**
- Use `const` wherever possible.
- Prefer range-based for loops for readability.
- Use smart pointers if you manage dynamic memory.
- Group related functions in namespaces or classes.

## 12. **Example: Modular Error Response**
```cpp
// In WebServer.hpp
void send_error(int client_fd, int code, const std::string& msg, size_t i);

// In WebServer.cpp
void WebServer::send_error(int client_fd, int code, const std::string& msg, size_t i) {
    Response(client_fd, code, msg, "<h1>" + std::to_string(code) + " " + msg + "</h1>", single_header("Content-Type", "text/html"));
    cleanup_client(client_fd, i);
}
```
Now, everywhere you need an error:
```cpp
send_error(client_fd, 404, "Not Found", i);
```

---

## 13. **Example: Utility for Content-Type**
```cpp
std::map<std::string, std::string> content_type(const std::string& type) {
    return single_header("Content-Type", type);
}
```
Usage:
```cpp
Response(client_fd, 200, "OK", body, content_type("application/json"));
```

---

## 14. **Directory Structure**
- Group related files (e.g., server, http, utils, cgi).
- Keep headers and implementations together.

---

## 15. **Documentation**
- Add comments for all public methods and complex logic.
- Consider Doxygen-style comments for classes and functions.

---

**Summary:**  
- Centralize repeated logic (responses, headers, file serving).
- Use utility functions and classes for modularity.
- Improve logging, error handling, and configuration.
- Use C++ best practices for clarity and maintainability.
